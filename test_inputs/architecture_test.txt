Modern web applications use a multi-tier architecture pattern for scalability and maintainability.

The typical architecture consists of several key layers. First, the client application sends requests through an API gateway. This API acts as the entry point for all incoming traffic.

    A[Client App] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Auth Service]
    B --> D[Cache Layer]
    D --> E[Database]
    C --> E
```

Behind the API gateway, we have a cache layer that stores frequently accessed data. The cache improves performance by reducing database queries. When the cache misses, the system queries the database directly.

The authentication service validates user credentials and manages session tokens. This service works independently but shares the same database for user information.

This microservice architecture enables independent scaling of each component based on load patterns.
